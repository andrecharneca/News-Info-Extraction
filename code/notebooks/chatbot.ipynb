The premium carmaker, which sold around 190,000 cars in the U.S. last year, accounting for 11% of its total sales, does not yet have a plant in the country, and is at present not eligible for tax incentives and subsidies offered under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) for vehicles sourced and made in North America. The $430-billion IRA was passed last August and offers subsidies and tax incentives for a swathe of domestically produced green industry products, including a $7,500 consumer tax credit to buyers of North American-made electric vehicles. It also includes a restriction on battery minerals and component sourcing to the region, in an attempt to phase out Chinese inputs. Audi plans to produce electric cars in all its locations globally by 2030, with no new combustion-engine models to be introduced beyond 2026. \\\\\"The IRA has made building a U.S. plant for electric cars very attractive,\\\\\" Audi Chief Executive Markus Duesmann said in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, adding that it would most likely build a joint plant with the Volkswagen Group.

Volkswagen said last May it planned to reintroduce the Scout off-road brand, creating a separate, independent company to build Scout trucks and SUVs starting in 2026 that will be designed, engineered, and manufactured in the United States for U.S. customers. Automobilwoche had reported in November that the carmaker was in talks with Foxconn (2317.TW), which has expanded into building electric vehicles (EVs) for auto brands, and Magna International subsidiary Magna Steyr (MG.TO) about building a joint plant. Building its own plant was the least likely option, the publication reported at the time, also citing company sources. Volkswagen is expanding its existing U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to produce the ID. Buzz. However, the Scout brand will build off-road electric pick-up trucks and SUVs that require a new platform and the Chattanooga plant does not have enough space to do it all, a source told Reuters last May. A spokesperson for Volkswagen said that a decision on whether to open a plant for Scout had not yet been made but that production was still due to begin 2026 as previously stated.

Puskar, File) TOKYO (AP) \\\\u2014 Japanese automaker Nissan is revving up its electrification shift and slashing costs by using the same components across models and reducing use of expensive rare materials. Nissan Motor Co. presented its \\\\u201cX-in-1\\\\u201d development strategy Thursday, in which the X stands for various powertrain parts such as an electric motor and inverter that can be used across models. The company said development and manufacturing costs will be reduced by 30% in 2026 compared to 2019 levels. The Yokohama-based automaker was a pioneer in electric vehicles but rivals like Tesla and BYD of China have overtaken it. As the move toward ecological models gains momentum around the world, driven by worries over climate change, Nissan has been eager to showcase its prowess. Its senior vice president, Toshihiro Hirai, acknowledged that prices of rare earths and other materials needed to make electric vehicle batteries and other parts are expected to rise in coming years. That means automakers must have a solid strategy for obtaining raw materials if they\", \"title: Japan\\\\u2019s Nissan slashing EV costs, cuts rare materials use url: https://apnews.com/article/nissan-electric-vehicles-rare-earths-92e953edca010476124c45a8544f5b38 date: 2023-03-09 01:21:41  That means automakers must have a solid strategy for obtaining raw materials if they hope to succeed in electrification. \\\\u201cWe make the most of our expertise and know-how from our more than a decadelong development and production of electrified technologies,\\\\u201d said Hirai. Compared to the first-generation vehicle the Leaf, rare materials account for 25% of the weight of the 2019 Nissan Note EV. Nissan aims to make that 1% or less. Nissan, which also makes the March subcompact and Infiniti luxury models, is working on solid-state battery technology for EVs, a move that if successful is expected to radically reduce costs. By 2030, Nissan\\\\u2019s EV offerings will cost about the same at dealers as the equivalent regular gasoline-engine models, Hirai said. The cheapest EVs like the Leaf now sell for under $30,000, although small internal-combustion engine cars are cheaper, at about $21,000 for the Nissan Sentra in the U.S. A Tesla Model 3, a relatively affordable model for a Tesla, sells for about $43,000. But EVs are usually eligible for tax credits and other incentives. High gasoline prices might make EVs a smart buy in the long run, although much depends on the owner\\\\u2019s driving habits. A Consumer Reports analysis last year said that based on the gas price at that time of $4.31 a gallon, EV owners could save between $1,800 and $2,600 in operating and maintenance costs for every 15,000 miles they drive, compared to drivers of gas-powered vehicles. That\\\\u2019s the average distance newer vehicles are driven in a year in the U.S. Gas prices have since fallen, so the savings would be lower but still significant. Hirai said people\", \"title: Japan\\\\u2019s Nissan slashing EV costs, cuts rare materials use url: https://apnews.com/article/nissan-electric-vehicles-rare-earths-92e953edca010476124c45a8544f5b38 date: 2023-03-09 01:21:41  fallen, so the savings would be lower but still significant. Hirai said people find driving an electric vehicle less stressful because it\\\\u2019s quiet and delivers a smooth ride, even over rough terrain, while maintaining the fun feel of driving. One advantage of an EV is its more precise control over each wheel, which can effectively counter bumps and jolts. Nissan has promised 27 new electrified models, including eight e-Power \\\\u201cseries hybrid\\\\u201d models, which have both a gas engine and electric motor, by fiscal 2030. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Find more AP coverage of technology at https://apnews.com/hub/technology\", \"title: Boeing temporarily halts deliveries of 787 Dreamliner jets - FAA url: https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-halts-deliveries-787-dreamliner-jets-faa-2023-02-23/ date: 2023-02-23 00:00:00  WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) has temporarily halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets as the U.S. planemaker conducts additional analysis on a fuselage component, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday. Deliveries will not resume until the FAA is satisfied that the issue has been addressed, the agency said. \\\\\"The FAA is working with Boeing to determine any actions that might be required for recently delivered airplanes,\\\\\" the agency said.

In August, the FAA approved the first 787 for delivery since May 2021 after it approved the planemaker\\'s inspection and modification plan. Boeing delivered 31 787s in 2022 and said last month it expects to deliver between 70 and 80 787s this year. Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said last month on an earnings call \\\\\"it\\'s going to take us a little bit longer\\\\\" to get to producing five 787s per month later this year. \\\\\"But we still see 70 to 80 in the cards,\\\\\" West said. Boeing had halted deliveries in 2021 after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. In September 2020, the FAA said it was investigating manufacturing flaws in some 787 jetliners. The current issue is unrelated to a previous quality problem involving gaps around the forward pressure bulkhead, which was discovered by the FAA in 2021 and contributed to a delivery stoppage that lasted until August 2022.

Automobilwoche had reported in November that the carmaker was in talks with Foxconn (2317.TW), which has expanded into building electric vehicles (EVs) for auto brands, and Magna International subsidiary Magna Steyr (MG.TO) about building a joint plant. Building its own plant was the least likely option, the publication reported at the time, also citing company sources. Volkswagen is expanding its existing U.S. plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to produce the ID. Buzz. However, the Scout brand will build off-road electric pick-up trucks and SUVs that require a new platform and the Chattanooga plant does not have enough space to do it all, a source told Reuters last May. A spokesperson for Volkswagen said that a decision on whether to open a plant for Scout had not yet been made but that production was still due to begin 2026 as previously stated. Volkswagen-owned Audi\\'s CEO Markus Duesmann said in an interview on Friday that the premium brand could build a plant in the U.S. either alone or together with the Volkswagen Group for EVs, though no decision had been made on that either.

Puskar, File) TOKYO (AP) \\\\u2014 Japanese automaker Nissan is revving up its electrification shift and slashing costs by using the same components across models and reducing use of expensive rare materials. Nissan Motor Co. presented its \\\\u201cX-in-1\\\\u201d development strategy Thursday, in which the X stands for various powertrain parts such as an electric motor and inverter that can be used across models. The company said development and manufacturing costs will be reduced by 30% in 2026 compared to 2019 levels. The Yokohama-based automaker was a pioneer in electric vehicles but rivals like Tesla and BYD of China have overtaken it. As the move toward ecological models gains momentum around the world, driven by worries over climate change, Nissan has been eager to showcase its prowess. Its senior vice president, Toshihiro Hirai, acknowledged that prices of rare earths and other materials needed to make electric vehicle batteries and other parts are expected to rise in coming years. That means automakers must have a solid strategy for obtaining raw materials if they\", \"title: Japan\\\\u2019s Nissan slashing EV costs, cuts rare materials use url: https://apnews.com/article/nissan-electric-vehicles-rare-earths-92e953edca010476124c45a8544f5b38 date: 2023-03-09 01:21:41  That means automakers must have a solid strategy for obtaining raw materials if they hope to succeed in electrification. \\\\u201cWe make the most of our expertise and know-how from our more than a decadelong development and production of electrified technologies,\\\\u201d said Hirai. Compared to the first-generation vehicle the Leaf, rare materials account for 25% of the weight of the 2019 Nissan Note EV. Nissan aims to make that 1% or less. Nissan, which also makes the March subcompact and Infiniti luxury models, is working on solid-state battery technology for EVs, a move that if successful is expected to radically reduce costs. By 2030, Nissan\\\\u2019s EV offerings will cost about the same at dealers as the equivalent regular gasoline-engine models, Hirai said. The cheapest EVs like the Leaf now sell for under $30,000, although small internal-combustion engine cars are cheaper, at about $21,000 for the Nissan Sentra in the U.S. A Tesla Model 3, a relatively affordable model for a Tesla, sells for about $43,000. But EVs are usually eligible for tax credits and other incentives. High gasoline prices might make EVs a smart buy in the long run, although much depends on the owner\\\\u2019s driving habits. A Consumer Reports analysis last year said that based on the gas price at that time of $4.31 a gallon, EV owners could save between $1,800 and $2,600 in operating and maintenance costs for every 15,000 miles they drive, compared to drivers of gas-powered vehicles. That\\\\u2019s the average distance newer vehicles are driven in a year in the U.S. Gas prices have since fallen, so the savings would be lower but still significant.

Hirai said people find driving an electric vehicle less stressful because it\\\\u2019s quiet and delivers a smooth ride, even over rough terrain, while maintaining the fun feel of driving. One advantage of an EV is its more precise control over each wheel, which can effectively counter bumps and jolts. Nissan has promised 27 new electrified models, including eight e-Power \\\\u201cseries hybrid\\\\u201d models, which have both a gas engine and electric motor, by fiscal 2030. ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Find more AP coverage of technology at https://apnews.com/hub/technology\", \"title: Boeing temporarily halts deliveries of 787 Dreamliner jets - FAA url: https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-halts-deliveries-787-dreamliner-jets-faa-2023-02-23/ date: 2023-02-23 00:00:00  WASHINGTON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) has temporarily halted deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner jets as the U.S. planemaker conducts additional analysis on a fuselage component, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday. Deliveries will not resume until the FAA is satisfied that the issue has been addressed, the agency said. \\\\\"The FAA is working with Boeing to determine any actions that might be required for recently delivered airplanes,\\\\\" the agency said.

In August, the FAA approved the first 787 for delivery since May 2021 after it approved the planemaker\\'s inspection and modification plan. Boeing delivered 31 787s in 2022 and said last month it expects to deliver between 70 and 80 787s this year. Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said last month on an earnings call \\\\\"it\\'s going to take us a little bit longer\\\\\" to get to producing five 787s per month later this year. \\\\\"But we still see 70 to 80 in the cards,\\\\\" West said. Boeing had halted deliveries in 2021 after the FAA raised concerns about its proposed inspection method. In September 2020, the FAA said it was investigating manufacturing flaws in some 787 jetliners. The current issue is unrelated to a previous quality problem involving gaps around the forward pressure bulkhead, which was discovered by the FAA in 2021 and contributed to a delivery stoppage that lasted until August 2022.

Globally, IPOs across all sectors nosedived last year after a blockbuster 2021, as aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks to curb inflation put an end to the era of cheap money. In the biotech sector, there were only 47 IPOs last year that raised a total of about $4 billion, compared with 152 offerings in 2021 that had raised over $25 billion. However, more biotech companies are expected to tap the U.S. IPO market this year as the Federal Reserve dials down the size of its rate hikes and private investment rounds fail to raise adequate capital to fund expensive clinical trials, industry experts told Reuters. Still, companies that have not yet tested their drugs on humans may find it hard to attract equity investors\\' attention given tighter financial conditions and a slew of disappointments from preclinical companies that went public during the IPO boom of 2021. \\\\\"The pattern of the past few years has been to come to the market with almost anything, no matter how substantial the validation,\\\\\" said David Pinniger, fund manager of the Biotech fund at Polar Capital. \\\\\"In these more discerning days, the weight of clinical evidence is probably going to have to be that much greater,\\\\\" Pinniger added.

While the XBI is still trading 50% below its February 2021 closing high, analysts believe the downturn in biotech has bottomed out.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Facebook parent Meta is slashing 10,000 jobs, about as many as the social media company announced late last year in its first round of cuts, as uncertainly about the global economy hits the technology sector particularly hard.

Globally, IPOs across all sectors nosedived last year after a blockbuster 2021, as aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks to curb inflation put an end to the era of cheap money. In the biotech sector, there were only 47 IPOs last year that raised a total of about $4 billion, compared with 152 offerings in 2021 that had raised over $25 billion. However, more biotech companies are expected to tap the U.S. IPO market this year as the Federal Reserve dials down the size of its rate hikes and private investment rounds fail to raise adequate capital to fund expensive clinical trials, industry experts told Reuters. Still, companies that have not yet tested their drugs on humans may find it hard to attract equity investors\\' attention given tighter financial conditions and a slew of disappointments from preclinical companies that went public during the IPO boom of 2021. \\\\\"The pattern of the past few years has been to come to the market with almost anything, no matter how substantial the validation,\\\\\" said David Pinniger, fund manager of the Biotech fund at Polar Capital. \\\\\"In these more discerning days, the weight of clinical evidence is probably going to have to be that much greater,\\\\\" Pinniger added. Several preclinical-stage biotechs that went public in 2021 are now trading well below their IPO price, including Sana Biotechnology (SANA.O), Tenaya Therapeutics (TNYA.O) and Virpax Pharmaceuticals (VRPX.O).

Reuters Graphics Along with challenging macro conditions, a string of disappointing clinical data and a dearth of large acquisitions had also sapped investor interest in the biotech sector in the first half of 2022, hammering company valuations. Small drug developers without any approved products on the market were forced to cut costs by dropping some drug study programs and implementing layoffs as funding dried up. Illustration photo shows various medicine pills in their original packaging in Brussels, Belgium August 9, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman/Illustration Sentiment started to rebound late in 2022 and has continued into this year, with the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF , considered a yardstick for the performance of small-cap biotech firms, having risen about 3% so far this year after posting its biggest annual loss last year. While the XBI is still trading 50% below its February 2021 closing high, analysts believe the downturn in biotech has bottomed out. They also believe the outlook for the rest of the year is much brighter given the likelihood of multi-billion dollar acquisitions and innovations such as genome editing and targeted cancer drug developments. Biopharma companies held more than $1.4 trillion in dealmaking capacity at the beginning of December 2022, according to a report by EY, with pharmaceutical giants facing patent expiries for their key drugs on the hunt for new promising assets. \\\\\"There was this dam holding back all this capital,\\\\\" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. \\\\\"Now we\\'re in this sweet spot where you\\'re seeing signs of disinflation, you\\'re seeing risk appetite improve.

Reuters Graphics The second half of 2023 is more likely to see a significant step-up in biotech IPOs instead of the first half, as markets await further clarity on potential rate cuts, analysts said. Along with robust clinical data, investors will be looking for companies with management teams that are capable of steering them to success after their stock market listings. \\\\\"A silver lining in the biotech downturn is that companies realize that they\\'re not necessarily entitled to great valuations because they have some interesting science,\\\\\" SMBC Nikko Securities America analyst David Hoang said. \\\\\"The way private companies are messaging their story and thinking about pushing their pipelines forward has improved compared to the last two years,\\\\\" Hoang added.

IKEA has a target to be climate positive - reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits - by 2030. It said emissions in the entire value chain - from raw material production to customers\\' use and disposal of products - was estimated to total 25.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the 12 months through August 2022, against an upwardly revised 27.2 million tonnes in the 2021 fiscal year. One of the main drivers of the reduction was the development of a more energy efficient LED bulb range called \\\\\"Solhetta\\\\\", said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive of the Inter IKEA Group that owns the IKEA brand. Helping suppliers to use more renewable energy in countries such as China - by getting them discounted loans and framework agreements to increase their access to clean power - also contributed to the emissions cut, he told Reuters. Inter IKEA acts as franchisor to IKEA store owners and is in charge of supply. Abrahamsson Ring said earlier that retail sales volumes did not increase in fiscal year 2022 as IKEA struggled to meet demand due to supply shortages. Retail sales were up on the back of price hikes, to 44.6 billion euros. Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores worldwide, reduced its own emissions by 23% to 455,014 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

IKEA has a target to be climate positive - reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits - by 2030. It said emissions in the entire value chain - from raw material production to customers\\' use and disposal of products - was estimated to total 25.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the 12 months through August 2022, against an upwardly revised 27.2 million tonnes in the 2021 fiscal year. One of the main drivers of the reduction was the development of a more energy efficient LED bulb range called \\\\\"Solhetta\\\\\", said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive of the Inter IKEA Group that owns the IKEA brand. Helping suppliers to use more renewable energy in countries such as China - by getting them discounted loans and framework agreements to increase their access to clean power - also contributed to the emissions cut, he told Reuters. Inter IKEA acts as franchisor to IKEA store owners and is in charge of supply. Abrahamsson Ring said earlier that retail sales volumes did not increase in fiscal year 2022 as IKEA struggled to meet demand due to supply shortages. Retail sales were up on the back of price hikes, to 44.6 billion euros. Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores worldwide, reduced its own emissions by 23% to 455,014 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The store owner\\'s emission reduction was also achieved by using more renewable energy.

New stores were planned in Norwich and Newcastle in England, it said in a statement. The company is also recruiting for 450 jobs across its 11 regional distribution centres. Aldi and Lidl, another German discount retailer, reported double-digit sales growth for the Christmas period on strong demand for their low-price products during a cost-of-living crisis.

Microsoft said most of those users responded positively, but others found Bing was insulting them, professing its love or voicing other disturbing or bizarre language.

In the two weeks since Microsoft unveiled its revamped Bing, more than a million users around the world have experimented with a public preview of the new product after signing up for a waitlist to try it. Microsoft said most of those users responded positively, but others found Bing was\", \"title: Microsoft brings Bing chatbot to phones after curbing quirks url: https://apnews.com/article/technology-mobile-phones-business-software-522a2225391a968ee1d791e32d8b91eb date: 2023-02-22 13:01:19  it. Microsoft said most of those users responded positively, but others found Bing was insulting them, professing its love or voicing other disturbing or bizarre language. Powered by some of the same technology behind the popular writing tool ChatGPT, built by Microsoft partner OpenAI , the new Bing is part of an emerging class of AI systems that have mastered human language and grammar after ingesting a huge trove of books and online writings. They can compose songs, recipes and emails on command, or concisely summarize concepts with information found across the internet. But they are also error-prone and unwieldy. Reports of Bing\\\\u2019s odd behavior led Microsoft to look for a way to curtail Bing\\\\u2019s propensity to respond with strong emotional language to certain questions. It\\\\u2019s mostly done that by limiting the length and time of conversations with the chatbot, forcing users to start a fresh chat after several turns. But the upgraded Bing also now politely declines questions that it would have responded to just a week ago. \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation,\\\\u201d it says when asked technical questions about how it works or the rules that guide it. \\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.\\\\u201d Microsoft said its new technology will also be integrated into its Skype messaging service.\", \"title: Baidu to implement ChatGPT-like Ernie Bot chatbot from March url: https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-baidu-inc-china-artificial-intelligence-427838070f962108cabed1e553fc3d12 date: 2023-02-22 10:57:29  Robin Li, CEO of search giant Baidu, talks about AI during the Baidu Create 2018 held in Beijing, China, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of its competitors, including Sony and Google. Microsoft announced a 10-year agreement with chipmaker Nvidia to bring Xbox games to Nvidia\\\\u2019s cloud gaming service.

Since its release, the tool has been used to write articles for at least one news publication, drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists and even passed graduate-level law and business exams (albeit with low marks). It has also prompted alarm about its unknown long-term consequences, such as its impact on education and students\\\\u2019 ability to cheat on assignments. Despite these concerns, the success of ChatGPT has spurred a global AI race. Microsoft plans to invest billions in the San Francisco-based OpenAI and unveiled its AI-powered Bing chatbot last week, though it made headlines for veering into darker, sometimes disturbing conversation.

Fang said his commercialization plan is to first develop those AI tools. Creators can then use the tools to make their own work and publish them on designated platforms for public viewing, following which the company can then sell ads, he said. He expects to launch the platforms later this year. Transformative potential Fang said he was directly inspired by OpenAI\\'s early version of ChatGPT tech in 2020. \\\\\"We all talk about the metaverse, but who is in it?\\\\\" he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \\\\\"It only changed our news. It didn\\'t change our lives.\\\\\" In contrast, he said generative AI tech can immediately provide value since it operates where users are already producing and consuming content.

The announcement comes after Microsoft President Brad Smith met with European Union officials on Tuesday in a bid to convince them that its planned $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard will be good for competition. Microsoft is offering the olive branch to stop the takeover from being blocked and thereby expand its gaming unit, which represents 9% of its total revenue. While sales of Microsoft\\'s Xbox consoles are slowing down, the company has been drawing on its cash pile to expand the collection of games it can sell and allow people to play through its cloud data centers.

Smith said if the Activision deal closes, it will bring all Activision Blizzard titles to GeForce Now. Nvidia is now on board with Microsoft\\'s pending deal for regulatory purposes, the two companies said in a joint statement confirming the two companies 10-year deal.

In November, the European Commission, the EU\\'s executive arm, opened an in-depth investigation into the deal citing concerns that it could reduce competition in the video games market. Activision Blizzard is the company behind popular game franchise Call of Duty. The EU commission said last year it is concerned that Microsoft could block access to the game on other platforms if the deal goes through. The commission is also concerned that it could give Microsoft an unfair edge in the nascent area of cloud gaming. Microsoft has a service called Game Pass through which it charges gamers $9.99 per month to access a library of games. The Activision takeover would add some high-profile titles to Game Pass. Nvidia\\'s GeForce Now has over 25 million members, while Microsoft said last year that 25 million people subscribe to Game Pass. Nvidia offers free and paid GeForce Now tiers, although high resolution is only available to those who pay. Members of GeForce Now will be able to stream through the cloud the games they buy through Microsoft\\'s app store, along with games listed in Epic Games and Steam\\'s app stores. In December, Microsoft said it had \\\\\"entered into a 10-year commitment\\\\\" to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo when the Activision acquisition closes.

Global AI race ChatGPT burst onto the scene in December, quickly going viral thanks to its ability to provide lengthy, thorough \\\\u2014 though sometimes inaccurate \\\\u2014 responses to questions and prompts. Since its release, the tool has been used to write articles for at least one news publication, drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists and even passed graduate-level law and business exams (albeit with low marks). It has also prompted alarm about its unknown long-term consequences, such as its impact on education and students\\\\u2019 ability to cheat on assignments. Despite these concerns, the success of ChatGPT has spurred a global AI race. Microsoft plans to invest billions in the San Francisco-based OpenAI and unveiled its AI-powered Bing chatbot last week, though it made headlines for veering into darker, sometimes disturbing conversation. Earlier this month, Google announced it will soon roll out Bard, its own answer to ChatGPT.

Big tech companies in the U.S. and China rushed this month to announce they are working on similar AI tools. Their announcements often referenced Microsoft-backed ChatGPT, while disclosing few details on what they themselves were working on. The artificial intelligence-powered chatbot ChatGPT has taken the tech world by storm in the last few months with its ability to generate everything from poems to business strategies in a human-like conversation. Still, analysts say the tech is transformative, something that\\'s also been said about blockchain and the metaverse. Competitive landscape Here\\'s what companies \\\\u2014 including those in China \\\\u2014 are doing in this specialized area of AI: U.S. startup OpenAI raced to beat rivals by launching ChatGPT in November, according to The New York Times, citing sources.

Fang said his commercialization plan is to first develop those AI tools. Creators can then use the tools to make their own work and publish them on designated platforms for public viewing, following which the company can then sell ads, he said. He expects to launch the platforms later this year. Transformative potential Fang said he was directly inspired by OpenAI\\'s early version of ChatGPT tech in 2020. \\\\\"We all talk about the metaverse, but who is in it?\\\\\" he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. \\\\\"It only changed our news. It didn\\'t change our lives.\\\\\" In contrast, he said generative AI tech can immediately provide value since it operates where users are already producing and consuming content. Generative AI can also lower production costs, allowing animators and speakers of minority languages to easily create their own content, Fang said.

The announcement comes after Microsoft President Brad Smith met with European Union officials on Tuesday in a bid to convince them that its planned $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard will be good for competition. Microsoft is offering the olive branch to stop the takeover from being blocked and thereby expand its gaming unit, which represents 9% of its total revenue. While sales of Microsoft\\'s Xbox consoles are slowing down, the company has been drawing on its cash pile to expand the collection of games it can sell and allow people to play through its cloud data centers. Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a press conference that, effective immediately, its Xbox games will be available on Nvidia\\'s GeForce Now cloud games service. Smith said if the Activision deal closes, it will bring all Activision Blizzard titles to GeForce Now. Nvidia is now on board with Microsoft\\'s pending deal for regulatory purposes, the two companies said in a joint statement confirming the two companies 10-year deal. In January Bloomberg reported that Nvidia had gone to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with complaints about the Activision deal. \\\\\"Combining the incredibly rich catalog of Xbox first party games with GeForce Now\\'s high-performance streaming capabilities will propel cloud gaming into a mainstream offering that appeals to gamers at all levels of interest and experience,\\\\\" Jeff Fisher, Nvidia\\'s senior vice president for GeForce, was quoted as saying. \\\\\"Through this partnership, more of the world\\'s most popular titles will now be available from the cloud with just a click, playable by millions more gamers.\\\\\" Microsoft proposed its Activision Blizzard acquisition in January 2022, but since then, the buyer has faced pushback\", \"title: Nvidia supports Microsoft, Activision merger after Xbox deal to add games to cloud service url: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html date: 2023-02-21 00:00:00  Blizzard acquisition in January 2022, but since then, the buyer has faced pushback from regulators in the U.S., European Union and U.K. The Nvidia arrangement is meaningful because \\\\\"now we\\'re addressing the full range of issues that have been raised by regulators as topics of not just interest but in some cases concern,\\\\\" Smith said at the press conference. In November, the European Commission, the EU\\'s executive arm, opened an in-depth investigation into the deal citing concerns that it could reduce competition in the video games market. Activision Blizzard is the company behind popular game franchise Call of Duty. The EU commission said last year it is concerned that Microsoft could block access to the game on other platforms if the deal goes through. The commission is also concerned that it could give Microsoft an unfair edge in the nascent area of cloud gaming. Microsoft has a service called Game Pass through which it charges gamers $9.99 per month to access a library of games. The Activision takeover would add some high-profile titles to Game Pass. Nvidia\\'s GeForce Now has over 25 million members, while Microsoft said last year that 25 million people subscribe to Game Pass. Nvidia offers free and paid GeForce Now tiers, although high resolution is only available to those who pay. Members of GeForce Now will be able to stream through the cloud the games they buy through Microsoft\\'s app store, along with games listed in Epic Games and Steam\\'s app stores. In December, Microsoft said it had \\\\\"entered into a 10-year commitment\\\\\" to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo when the Activision acquisition closes. The announcement was seen as a move to assuage regulators\\' antitrust concerns. On Tuesday, Smith tweeted that the two signs have now signed a \\\\\"binding 10-year legal agreement\\\\\" to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players on the same day as Microsoft\\'s\"], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"encoding_format\": \"base64\"}' message='Post details'\n",

Sony\\\\u2019s gaming chief Jim Ryan was also in attendance, Reuters added. Sony, Microsoft\\\\u2019s biggest rival, opposes the Activision takeover.  Sony was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.  During a press conference on Tuesday, Smith held up a piece of paper saying it is an agreement he is ready to send to Sony.  Smith told CNBC that Microsoft is offering Sony the same agreement as Nintendo \\\\u2014 to have Call of Duty available on the PlayStation the same time as Xbox with the same features.

The U.K.\\\\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said this month that the takeover raises competition concerns and may result in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation. The regulator said it could move to block the deal and suggested several remedies Microsoft could take. One of those involved Microsoft divesting the business responsible for Call of Duty.  Smith said that Microsoft doesn\\\\u2019t see a \\\\u201cfeasible path\\\\u201d to sell off the Call of Duty game.  \\\\u201cIt just isn\\\\u2019t something that seems to be lining up,\\\\u201d Smith told CNBC.  \\\\u201cThe only reason to sell it off is the CMA\\\\u2019s potential concern that if we buy it, we won\\\\u2019t provide it to others as broadly. I think that concern should be dispelled by the two agreements we\\\\u2019ve signed today.\\\\u201d  In December, the FTC filed an antitrust case against Microsoft attempting to block the Activision deal.  Google parent Alphabet also went to the FTC with dissatisfaction about Microsoft\\\\u2019s deal, Bloomberg reported.  \\\\u201cThe European Commission asked for our views in the course of their inquiries into this issue. We will continue to cooperate in any processes, when requested, to ensure all views are considered,\\\\u201d a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

The Nvidia agreement addresses that as the GeForce\", \"title: Nvidia supports Microsoft, Activision merger after Xbox deal to add games to cloud service url: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html date: 2023-02-21 00:00:00  Smith said.  The Nvidia agreement addresses that as the GeForce Now cloud gaming service is available on ChromeOS, Smith said. Microsoft is able to maintain compliance with the sorts agreements with European regulators that might require it to keep Call of Duty on Chrome OS, he said during the press conference.  \\\\u201cWith the agreement we\\\\u2019ve done with Nvidia, we\\\\u2019ve just ensured Google will benefit as well,\\\\u201d Smith said.  Microsoft has maintained that its takeover of Activision Blizzard would not harm competition in video gaming and instead increase competition against large players like Sony and Chinese giant Tencent.  Microsoft has remained behind the likes of Sony and Nintendo in the video-gaming business. Microsoft\\\\u2019s Xboxes have lagged Sony\\\\u2019s PlayStation 5 and Nintendo\\\\u2019s Switch. Sony and Nintendo\\\\u2019s popularity has come from its large number of successful first-party games. Microsoft is looking to boost its games library with the Activision acquisition.

The company saw its share value drop more than 65%, reflecting the chilly environment for both SPACs and ridesharing companies. Getaround, which made the very first CNBC Disruptor 50 list in 2013, allows users to rent cars and trucks from each other via a digital marketplace. The company launched in 2009 and is available in more than 1,000 cities in the United States and Europe. The merger had valued the company at about $1.2 billion, and Getaround said it planned to use the funds to invest in new markets and expand its products. SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, raise capital through an IPO to acquire or merge with existing companies, aiming to eventually take the companies public in a two-year time frame. Though SPACs rose in popularity in 2020 and 2021, they tend to significantly underperform in comparison to traditional IPOs. The appetite for SPACs, which often back early-stage growth companies with little earnings, have diminished in the face of rising rates as well as elevated market volatility. For SPACs that did go public, they haven\\'t fared well: the CNBC SPAC Post Deal Index has fallen over 60% in the past year. Public ridesharing companies have been struggling as well.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne, File) NEW YORK (AP) \\\\u2014 Amazon plans to eliminate 9,000 more jobs in the next few weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday. The job cuts would mark the second largest round of layoffs in the company\\\\u2019s history, adding to the 18,000 employees the tech giant said it would lay off in January. The company\\\\u2019s workforce doubled during the pandemic, however, in the midst of a hiring surge across almost the entire tech sector. Tech companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts this year. In the memo, Jassy said the second phase of the company\\\\u2019s annual planning process completed this month led to the additional job cuts.

The job cuts announced Monday will hit profitable areas for the company including its cloud computing unit AWS and its burgeoning advertising business. Twitch, the gaming platform Amazon owns, will also see some layoffs as well as Amazon\\\\u2019s PXT organizations, which handle human resources and other functions. Prior layoffs had also hit PXT, the company\\\\u2019s stores division, which encompasses its e-commerce business as well as company\\\\u2019s brick-and-mortar stores such as Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and other departments such as the one that runs the virtual assistant Alexa. Earlier this month, the company said it would pause construction on its headquarters building in northern Virginia, though the first phase of that project will open this June with 8,000 employees. Like other tech companies, including Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet , Amazon ramped up hiring during the pandemic to meet the demand from homebound Americans that were increasingly buying stuff online to keep themselves safe from the virus. Amazon\\\\u2019s workforce, in warehouses and offices, doubled to more than 1.6 million people in about two years. But demand slowed as the worst of the pandemic eased.

The company saw its share value drop more than 65%, reflecting the chilly environment for both SPACs and ridesharing companies. Getaround, which made the very first CNBC Disruptor 50 list in 2013, allows users to rent cars and trucks from each other via a digital marketplace. The company launched in 2009 and is available in more than 1,000 cities in the United States and Europe. The merger had valued the company at about $1.2 billion, and Getaround said it planned to use the funds to invest in new markets and expand its products. SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, raise capital through an IPO to acquire or merge with existing companies, aiming to eventually take the companies public in a two-year time frame. Though SPACs rose in popularity in 2020 and 2021, they tend to significantly underperform in comparison to traditional IPOs. The appetite for SPACs, which often back early-stage growth companies with little earnings, have diminished in the face of rising rates as well as elevated market volatility. For SPACs that did go public, they haven\\'t fared well: the CNBC SPAC Post Deal Index has fallen over 60% in the past year. Public ridesharing companies have been struggling as well.

Getaround had raised approximately $600 million in funding. Its financing, like many start-ups over the past decade, grew quickly, from a series C round in 2017 of $45 million to a series D in 2018 of $300 million, led by Softbank, a deal Toyota also took part in.

In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday. There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn\\\\u2019t work out well for shareholders in the long run. It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it\\\\u2019s also possible that \\\\u201cwe just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,\\\\u201d said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics. There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it\\\\u2019s \\\\u201chard to predict where the problems will emerge,\\\\u201d she said.

Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS. Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse\\\\u2019s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks . Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was \\\\u201can international banking crisis in the making.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cMarkets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,\\\\u201d he said. Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail. UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS.

The combination of the two Swiss banks, each with histories dating to the mid-19th century, strikes at the country\\\\u2019s reputation as a global financial center \\\\u2014 putting it on the cusp of having a single big national bank that would be too big to fail.

Shares of Credit Suisse , whose woes stem from questions over its internal controls, closed nearly 56% lower a day after UBS said it would buy its fellow Swiss bank for a lowball price of 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion).

In an indication of the frantic, behind-the-scenes deal-making to resolve the issue before markets opened, the acquisition was announced late Sunday. There is still uncertainty over how the deal will play out for the combined lender and what comes next for the wider banking system. Analysts say some previous forced bank mergers didn\\\\u2019t work out well for shareholders in the long run. It could be that no more banks get into trouble, but it\\\\u2019s also possible that \\\\u201cwe just go from one weak institution falling over to the next,\\\\u201d said Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser at Capital Economics. There no other obvious candidates that could be singled out like Credit Suisse, but it\\\\u2019s \\\\u201chard to predict where the problems will emerge,\\\\u201d she said. UBS shares initially dropped on the Swiss stock exchange but closed up 1.3%. The deal whipsawed other European bank stocks , which tumbled before some clawed back their losses. Germany\\\\u2019s Deutsche Bank, France\\\\u2019s BNP Paribas and Italy\\\\u2019s UniCredit ended higher, while London-based Barclays sank 2.3%. Swiss authorities urged UBS to take over its smaller rival after a central bank plan for Credit Suisse to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($54 billion) last week failed to reassure investors and customers.

Those U.S. failures have raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already\", \"title: Credit Suisse-UBS deal offers hope, but bank doubts persist url: https://apnews.com/article/credit-suisse-ubs-swiss-bank-svb-7d4c2c82b6df9830c0254ef0de62e870 date: 2023-03-20 05:52:45  raised questions about other potentially weak global financial institutions, sweeping up the already beleaguered Swiss bank. Credit Suisse has faced an array of troubles in recent years, including bad bets on hedge funds , repeated shakeups of its top management and a spying scandal involving UBS. Analysts and financial leaders say safeguards are stronger since the 2008 global financial crisis and that banks worldwide have plenty of available cash and support from central banks. But concerns about risks to the deal, losses for some investors and Credit Suisse\\\\u2019s falling market value could renew fears about the health of banks . Tobias Straumann, an economic history professor at University of Zurich, said the merger was the right move because the U.S. bank collapses and the danger to Credit Suisse was \\\\u201can international banking crisis in the making.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cMarkets are very nervous, and I think an additional accident in Switzerland would have fueled a lot of problems,\\\\u201d he said. Credit Suisse is among 30 financial institutions known as globally systemically important banks, and authorities were worried about the fallout if it were to fail. UBS is bigger but Credit Suisse wields considerable influence, with $1.4 trillion assets under management. It has significant trading desks around the world, caters to the rich through its wealth management business, and is a major mergers and acquisitions adviser. However, Credit Suisse weathered the 2008 financial crisis without assistance, unlike UBS. As part of the deal, approximately 16 billion francs ($17.3 billion) in higher-risk Credit Suisse bonds will be wiped out, leaving investors with hefty losses.

He must convince investors that even though rivals are catching up, the electric-vehicle pioneer can make another leap forward to widen its lead. Tesla was the No. 1 EV maker worldwide in 2022, but China\\'s BYD and others are closing the gap fast, according to a Reuters analysis of global and regional EV sales data provided by EV-volumes.com. In fact, BYD passed Tesla in EV sales last year in the Asia-Pacific region, while the Volkswagen Group has been the EV leader in Europe since 2020. While Tesla narrowed VW\\'s lead in Europe, the U.S. automaker surrendered ground in Asia-Pacific as well as its home market as the competition heats up. The most significant challenges to Tesla are coming from established automakers and a group of Chinese EV manufacturers. Several U.S. EV startups that hoped to ride Tesla\\'s coattails are struggling, including luxury EV maker Lucid, whose shares plunged 16 percent on Thursday after disappointing sales and financial results. Over the next two years, rivals including General Motors, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and VW will launch scores of new electric vehicles, from a Chevrolet priced below $30,000 to luxury sedans and SUVs that top $100,000.

REUTERS/Joe Skipper CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb 27 (Reuters) - NASA and SpaceX early on Monday postponed the launch of a capsule containing two U.S. astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a United Arab Emirates crewmate minutes before scheduled lift-off from Florida on a flight to the International Space Station. The U.S. space agency and SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, cited a technical glitch concerning the ignition fluid used to start the spacecraft\\'s engines. The countdown had seemed to be progressing smoothly until about two and a half minutes before blastoff, when NASA announced on its live webcast that the launch of the four crew members on a six-month science mission would be postponed. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket topped with a Crew Dragon capsule had been scheduled for liftoff at 1:45 a.m. EST (0645 GMT) from NASA\\'s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The first backup launch opportunity for the mission was set for early Tuesday, about 24 hours from the initial attempt to get the rocket off the ground. Neither NASA nor SpaceX immediately said how long it might actually take before they would be ready to try again. Eleventh-hour launch scrubs are fairly routine in the highly complex and risky endeavor of human spaceflight.

Designated Crew 6, the mission will carry the sixth long-duration ISS team that NASA has flown aboard SpaceX since Musk\\'s California-based company began sending American astronauts to orbit in May 2020. The latest ISS crew is led by mission commander Stephen Bowen, 59, a one-time U.S. Navy submarine officer who has logged more than 40 days in orbit as a veteran of three space shuttle flights and seven spacewalks. Fellow NASA astronaut Warren \\\\\"Woody\\\\\" Hoburg, 37, an engineer and commercial aviator designated as the Crew 6 pilot, will be making his first spaceflight. The Crew 6 mission also is notable for its inclusion of UAE astronaut Sultan Alneyadi, 41, only the second person from his country to fly to space and the first to launch from U.S. soil as part of a long-duration space station team. UAE\\'s first-ever astronaut launched to orbit in 2019 aboard a Russian spacecraft. Rounding out the four-man Crew 6 is Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev, 41, who like Alneyadi is an engineer and spaceflight rookie designated as a mission specialist for the team. Fedyaev is the latest cosmonaut to fly aboard an American spacecraft under a ride-sharing deal signed in July by NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, despite heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow over Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. The Crew 6 team will be welcomed aboard the space station by seven current ISS occupants - three U.S. NASA crew members, including commander Nicole Aunapu Mann, the first Native American woman to fly to space, along with three Russians and a Japanese astronaut.

Sales of existing homes \\\\u2014 which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops \\\\u2014 shot up 14.5% in February from January. But sales were down 22.6% from a year ago. The seasonally adjusted annualized sales pace dropped from 5.92 million units a year ago to 4.58 million. The steep decline in sales activity is driven by the large increase of mortgage rates over the past year. Mortgage rates remain volatile \\\\u2014 in February, rates rose half of percentage point \\\\u2014 but prices in some areas are cooling, according to NAR. \\\\u201cConscious of changing mortgage rates, home buyers are taking advantage of any rate declines,\\\\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\\\\u2019s chief economist. \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re seeing stronger sales gains in areas where home prices are decreasing and the local economies are adding jobs.\\\\u201d Inventory remains stubbornly low, said Yun.

The huge jump in sales was surprising, said Yun, showing just how sensitive homebuyers are to slight reductions in mortgage rates. \\\\u201cThe reason for the increase is that mortgage rates were somewhat lower in January and February and consumers wanted to take advantage of a rate that was around 6.3%, rather than closer to 7%,\\\\u201d said Yun. The big jump, he said, also revealed a dynamic in the market in which home buyers with a long-simmering housing search may jump on a listing quickly if it meets their needs. Markets were swift but slower than a year ago, according to NAR, with properties typically on the market for 34 days in February, up from 33 days in January and 18 days a year ago.

That upward trajectory in rates has been recently interrupted due to concerns about the health of the financial system after several bank failures. This has pushed rates lower over the past week. The future of mortgage rates will be impacted by what action the Federal Reserve decides to take with benchmark rates at its two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday. Home sellers considering putting their home on the market will still be in a strong position to cash in on home equity, said Jones, since low inventory and strong demand to buy has kept prices strong in many places. \\\\u201cBut the dwindling buyer pool makes the task more challenging.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cHome sales remain well below last year\\\\u2019s level, signaling that significant affordability gains must be made before buyers are able to return to the market en masse,\\\\u201d she added.\", \"title: From groceries to clothes, inflation-weary Americans flock to cheaper products online url: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/21/business/online-prices-cheaper-products date: 2023-03-21 00:00:00  New York CNN \\\\u2014 Nearly two years of high inflation has caused many consumers to say goodbye to premium goods in favor of cheaper alternatives. New research from Adobe Analytics, shared with CNN, spells out the scale of this trading-down trend playing out in online shopping. Across 11 categories of e-commerce, high-priced goods have lost meaningful market share to low-cost ones, according to Adobe. For instance, the most expensive quartile of personal care products held 31% of the market as of January 2019. As of the end of February this year, these pricier products make up just 7% of the market, according to Adobe. The cheapest tier of personal care products doubled its market share over that span to 54%. \\\\u201cAs inflation hits consumers and really impacts their buying power, they are shifting to the cheaper products offered online \\\\u2014 across the board,\\\\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. The trend is taking place even as inflation continues to cool off from a 41-year high hit in the middle of last year. A similar story is playing out in groceries, where prices on everything from meat and fruit to eggs have spiked over the past two years. In online groceries, the most expensive tier of products has gone from 24.5% of the market in January 2019 to 9% now. The cheapest tier of online groceries has grown in market share by 13 percentage points to nearly half the market, Adobe said. \\\\u201cConsumers are having to down-shift and forgo certain premium products and instead go for the cheaper ones. In groceries, that means people shifting from organic fruit to non-organic fruit,\\\\u201d Pandya said. Prices for food at home increased by 10.2% over the last 12 months, according to the government\\\\u2019s February Consumer Price Index inflation report. The shift away from expensive items\", \"title: From groceries to clothes, inflation-weary Americans flock to cheaper products online url: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/21/business/online-prices-cheaper-products date: 2023-03-21 00:00:00  the government\\\\u2019s February Consumer Price Index inflation report. The shift away from expensive items is one reason are the fastest growing food retailers in America, according to a Tufts University study released earlier this year. And lower-price supermarkets like Aldi have enjoyed stronger growth in recent years. Beyond food, online shoppers have traded down in electronics, where the cheapest tier of goods has spiked from 25% of the market to 39%, according to Adobe. \\\\u201cIn 2020, consumers were flush with stimulus dollars and savings. Now they are much more constrained,\\\\u201d said Pandya. Consumers are also very price conscious when it comes to buying clothes online. The most expensive tier of apparel was about one-fifth of the market as of January 2019 but today it stands at just one-tenth, Adobe said. Even pricey toys are taking a back seat. The most expensive tier of online toys has gone from 25% of the market four years ago to 13% today. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s pretty apparent we are still dealing with a very price-conscious consumer who has had to deal with a lot economically,\\\\u201d said Pandya. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s going to take time for them to shift away from this behavior.\\\\u201d\", \"title: Hollywood braces for potential strike as writers begin high-stakes talks with studios url: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/20/media/wga-hollywood-reliable-sources date: 2023-03-20 00:00:00  New York CNN \\\\u2014 Hollywood is holding its breath.

New research from Adobe Analytics, shared with CNN, spells out the scale of this trading-down trend playing out in online shopping. Across 11 categories of e-commerce, high-priced goods have lost meaningful market share to low-cost ones, according to Adobe. For instance, the most expensive quartile of personal care products held 31% of the market as of January 2019. As of the end of February this year, these pricier products make up just 7% of the market, according to Adobe. The cheapest tier of personal care products doubled its market share over that span to 54%. \\\\u201cAs inflation hits consumers and really impacts their buying power, they are shifting to the cheaper products offered online \\\\u2014 across the board,\\\\u201d said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. The trend is taking place even as inflation continues to cool off from a 41-year high hit in the middle of last year. A similar story is playing out in groceries, where prices on everything from meat and fruit to eggs have spiked over the past two years. In online groceries, the most expensive tier of products has gone from 24.5% of the market in January 2019 to 9% now. The cheapest tier of online groceries has grown in market share by 13 percentage points to nearly half the market, Adobe said. \\\\u201cConsumers are having to down-shift and forgo certain premium products and instead go for the cheaper ones. In groceries, that means people shifting from organic fruit to non-organic fruit,\\\\u201d Pandya said. Prices for food at home increased by 10.2% over the last 12 months, according to the government\\\\u2019s February Consumer Price Index inflation report. The shift away from expensive items\", \"title: From groceries to clothes, inflation-weary Americans flock to cheaper products online url: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/21/business/online-prices-cheaper-products date: 2023-03-21 00:00:00  the government\\\\u2019s February Consumer Price Index inflation report. The shift away from expensive items is one reason are the fastest growing food retailers in America, according to a Tufts University study released earlier this year. And lower-price supermarkets like Aldi have enjoyed stronger growth in recent years. Beyond food, online shoppers have traded down in electronics, where the cheapest tier of goods has spiked from 25% of the market to 39%, according to Adobe. \\\\u201cIn 2020, consumers were flush with stimulus dollars and savings. Now they are much more constrained,\\\\u201d said Pandya. Consumers are also very price conscious when it comes to buying clothes online. The most expensive tier of apparel was about one-fifth of the market as of January 2019 but today it stands at just one-tenth, Adobe said. Even pricey toys are taking a back seat. The most expensive tier of online toys has gone from 25% of the market four years ago to 13% today. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s pretty apparent we are still dealing with a very price-conscious consumer who has had to deal with a lot economically,\\\\u201d said Pandya. \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s going to take time for them to shift away from this behavior.\\\\u201d\", \"title: Hollywood braces for potential strike as writers begin high-stakes talks with studios url: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/20/media/wga-hollywood-reliable-sources date: 2023-03-20 00:00:00  New York CNN \\\\u2014 Hollywood is holding its breath. The Writers Guild of America commenced high-stakes negotiations with studios on Monday over a contract set to expire on May 1 \\\\u2014 which could lead to the first strike in nearly 15 years, a prospect that would cause massive disruption to television and film projects across the industry. The guild is heading to the Sherman Oaks bargaining table seeking higher compensation for writers, a boost in contributions to pension and health funds, and better workplace standards. Most notably, the guild wants to factor in the streaming economy into compensation packages for its members. Residual fees \\\\u2014 or money paid when a film or series is rerun or aired on broadcast \\\\u2014 has helped pad the wallets of writers for years.

Additionally, with the rise of streaming, there are often fewer episodes in a show\\\\u2019s season than before.

Negotiations would then resume with the aim of striking an agreement before May 1. The guild did not respond to a request seeking further comment on Monday.

The draft proposal, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, suggests creating a new type of vehicle category in the European Union for cars that can only run on carbon neutral fuels. Such vehicles would have to use technology that would prevent them from driving if other fuels are used, the draft said. The proposal could offer a route for carmakers to keep selling combustion engine vehicles after 2035, the date when a planned EU law is set to ban the sale of new CO2-emitting cars. After months of negotiations, EU countries and the European Parliament agreed the law last year. But Germany\\'s Transport Ministry surprised other countries this month by lodging last-minute objections to the law, days before a final vote that would have seen it enter into force. The Ministry\\'s core demand is that the EU allow sales of new cars running on e-fuels after 2035. On Tuesday, it said it was in contact with the Commission to try to reach a solution on an issue being closely watched by Germany\\'s powerful car industry. \\\\\"We are interested in a quick clarification, but it must be resilient and binding. We are currently examining this carefully,\\\\\" a spokesperson said. Two sources familiar with the matter said the Commission\\'s condition that cars must be able to recognise CO2-neutral fuels from fossil fuels\", \"title: Exclusive: EU drafts plan to allow e-fuel combustion engine cars url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-proposes-exception-e-fuel-combustion-engines-2035-2023-03-21/ date: 2023-03-21 14:50:39  that cars must be able to recognise CO2-neutral fuels from fossil fuels was problematic for Germany because it would largely force automakers to develop new engines. German Transport Minister Volker Wissing did not want to completely reject the Commission\\'s proposal, but rather make some improvements to it, the sources told Reuters. The parties are aiming to secure an agreement by Thursday\\'s EU summit. A Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the draft document, but referred to comments by EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans, who said last week any solution must comply with the 2035 phaseout law agreed last year. \\\\\"The talks are ongoing between the Commission and the German authorities,\\\\\" the spokesperson said. An EU official told Reuters on Monday that any proposal on registering e-fuel cars would only be made after the combustion engine phaseout law was finally adopted. E-fuels are made by synthesizing captured CO2 emissions and hydrogen produced using CO2-free electricity. They are not yet produced at scale. A study published on Tuesday by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research found that all planned e-fuel projects worldwide would only produce enough fuel to cover 10% of Germany\\'s demand for e-fuel use in aviation, shipping and chemicals in the next few years.

Australia and the Netherlands initiated the action over MH17 last year at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The passenger jet was struck over rebel-held eastern Ukraine by what international investigators and prosecutors say was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people on board. Australia has said Russia was responsible under international law and that taking the matter to ICAO would be a step forward in the fight for victims who included 38 Australians. The ICAO upheld its jurisdiction to hear the matter during a session on Friday, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a written statement. \\\\\"This decision is an important step in our collective efforts to hold to account those responsible for this horrific act of violence,\\\\\" Wong said. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra called the decision to hear the case \\\\\"an important step towards establishing the truth, justice and accountability\\\\\". \\\\\"Together with Australia, we will continue to do everything in our power to find closure for the loved ones of the 298 victims of flight #MH17,\\\\\" Hoekstra said on Twitter. Russia has denied any involvement in the incident, and Russia\\'s ICAO delegation was not immediately available for comment. While the outcome at ICAO is uncertain, experts said the move may be seen as a further way to force Russia into negotiations over the incident.

Jos\\\\u00e9 Luis Parra Navarro, a UGT union spokesman, said the workforce would become \\\\u201csurplus\\\\u201d when the plant switched to making electric cars because the work \\\\u201crequires less labor.\\\\u201d The plant is Ford\\\\u2019s only such facility in Spain and currently employs 5,400 people. The job cuts were \\\\u201cmainly due to the already announced discontinuing production of the S-Max and Galaxy models in April 2023,\\\\u201d Ford Spain said in an email. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has a strategy to offer an all-electric fleet in Europe by 2035 and says production of its first European-built electric car is expected to start later this year. The job cuts come amid a sea change in the global auto industry from gas-guzzling combustion engines to electric vehicles. Governments are pushing to reduce the emissions that contribute to climate change, and a resulting race to develop electric vehicles has generated intense competition among automakers. In January, Ford announced a new solar power plant had opened at the Valencia facility as it looks to become a carbon-neutral business.\", \"title: Exclusive: EU drafts plan to allow e-fuel combustion engine cars url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-proposes-exception-e-fuel-combustion-engines-2035-2023-03-21/ date: 2023-03-21 14:50:39  Summary Brussels proposes exception for e-fuels cars from 2035 Germany still examining EU draft proposal Berlin sees technology condition as problematic Goal to reach decision by Thursday BERLIN/BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - The European Commission has drafted a plan to allow sales of new cars with internal combustion engines after 2035 if they run only on climate neutral e-fuels, as it tries to resolve a spat with Germany over moves to phase out combustion engine cars. The draft proposal, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, suggests creating a new type of vehicle category in the European Union for cars that can only run on carbon neutral fuels. Such vehicles would have to use technology that would prevent them from driving if other fuels are used, the draft said. The proposal could offer a route for carmakers to keep selling combustion engine vehicles after 2035, the date when a planned EU law is set to ban the sale of new CO2-emitting cars. After months of negotiations, EU countries and the European Parliament agreed the law last year. But Germany\\'s Transport Ministry surprised other countries this month by lodging last-minute objections to the law, days before a final vote that would have seen it enter into force. The Ministry\\'s core demand is that the EU allow sales of new cars running on e-fuels after 2035. On Tuesday, it said it was in contact with the Commission to try to reach a solution on an issue being closely watched by Germany\\'s powerful car industry. \\\\\"We are interested in a quick clarification, but it must be resilient and binding. We are currently examining this carefully,\\\\\" a spokesperson said. Two sources familiar with the matter said the Commission\\'s condition that cars must be able to recognise CO2-neutral fuels from fossil fuels\", \"title: Exclusive: EU drafts plan to allow e-fuel combustion engine cars url: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-proposes-exception-e-fuel-combustion-engines-2035-2023-03-21/ date: 2023-03-21 14:50:39  that cars must be able to recognise CO2-neutral fuels from fossil fuels was problematic for Germany because it would largely force automakers to develop new engines. German Transport Minister Volker Wissing did not want to completely reject the Commission\\'s proposal, but rather make some improvements to it, the sources told Reuters. The parties are aiming to secure an agreement by Thursday\\'s EU summit. A Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the draft document, but referred to comments by EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans, who said last week any solution must comply with the 2035 phaseout law agreed last year. \\\\\"The talks are ongoing between the Commission and the German authorities,\\\\\" the spokesperson said. An EU official told Reuters on Monday that any proposal on registering e-fuel cars would only be made after the combustion engine phaseout law was finally adopted. E-fuels are made by synthesizing captured CO2 emissions and hydrogen produced using CO2-free electricity. They are not yet produced at scale. A study published on Tuesday by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research found that all planned e-fuel projects worldwide would only produce enough fuel to cover 10% of Germany\\'s demand for e-fuel use in aviation, shipping and chemicals in the next few years.

Australia and the Netherlands initiated the action over MH17 last year at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The passenger jet was struck over rebel-held eastern Ukraine by what international investigators and prosecutors say was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people on board. Australia has said Russia was responsible under international law and that taking the matter to ICAO would be a step forward in the fight for victims who included 38 Australians. The ICAO upheld its jurisdiction to hear the matter during a session on Friday, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a written statement. \\\\\"This decision is an important step in our collective efforts to hold to account those responsible for this horrific act of violence,\\\\\" Wong said. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra called the decision to hear the case \\\\\"an important step towards establishing the truth, justice and accountability\\\\\". \\\\\"Together with Australia, we will continue to do everything in our power to find closure for the loved ones of the 298 victims of flight #MH17,\\\\\" Hoekstra said on Twitter. Russia has denied any involvement in the incident, and Russia\\'s ICAO delegation was not immediately available for comment. While the outcome at ICAO is uncertain, experts said the move may be seen as a further way to force Russia into negotiations over the incident. The technical talks by ICAO\\'s 36-member governing council come as Moscow is facing mounting rebukes over aviation-related actions following its invasion of Ukraine. In October, Russia failed to win enough votes\", \"title: U.N. aviation council votes to hear MH17 case against Russia url: https://www.reuters.com/world/un-aviation-council-votes-hear-mh17-case-against-russia-2023-03-17/ date: 2023-03-17 00:00:00  actions following its invasion of Ukraine. In October, Russia failed to win enough votes at ICAO\\'s triennial assembly to keep its council seat. The council also called out Russia for the dual registration of commercial aircraft, which the body argued is at odds with parts of a key agreement that sets out core principles for global aviation. Montreal-based ICAO lacks regulatory power but holds moral suasion and sets global aviation standards overwhelmingly adopted by its 193-member states, even as it operates across political barriers.

TikTok has been seeking to assure governments and regulators that users\\\\u2019 personal data cannot be accessed and its content cannot be manipulated by China\\\\u2019s Communist Party or anyone else under Beijing\\\\u2019s influence. The short video sharing app, owned by China\\\\u2019s ByteDance, aims to expand its European data storage, TikTok\\\\u2019s general manager for operations in Europe Rich Waterworth said in a blog post. \\\\u201cWe are at an advanced stage of finalizing a plan for a second data center in Ireland with a third-party service provider, in addition to the site announced last year,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019re also in talks to establish a third data center in Europe to further complement our planned operations in Ireland. European TikTok user data will begin migrating this year, continuing into 2024,\\\\u201d Waterworth said. On Friday, the company also reported on average 125 million monthly active users in the European Union between August 2022 and January 2023, subjecting it to stricter EU online content rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA labels companies with more than 45 million users as very large online platforms and requires them to do risk management, external and independent auditing, share data with authorities and researchers, and adopt a code of conduct. The European Commission had given online platforms and search engines until February 17 to publish the number of their monthly active users. Very large online platforms have four months to comply with the rules, or risk fines.
