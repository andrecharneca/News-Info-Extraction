(March 21)\nAt the Los Angeles premiere of \"John Wick: Chapter 4,\" stars including Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne pay tribute to their late friend and co-star Lance Reddick, who unexpectedly died last week. (March 21)\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne were among the \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d stars honoring Lance Reddick, their co-star who died unexpectedly last week , at the film\u2019s Los Angeles premiere.\n\u201cWe lost our brother, and in a really sort of very shocking way. I think we\u2019re all still in shock. Life is,\u201d the visibly shaken Fishburne said, pausing briefly before continuing, \u201chard sometimes.\u201d\nMany of those who worked on the film wore blue ribbons to honor Reddick, who was a prolific character actor with prominent roles in \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cOz\u201d and the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d film franchise.\n\u201cJust to be in his light and to get a chance to work with him, I\u2019ll cherish for the rest of my life,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cHe had such a passion for his work and his craft. He was gracious. He had a dignity to him and a presence.\u201d\nReddick, 60, died Friday in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Mia Hansen said. No further details were provided.\nTributes have poured in for the actor, whose roles made him a beloved and recognizable star of television and films. He played Charon, the multi-skilled Continental Hotel concierge who is fond of Wick, an assassin played by Reeves. The latest installment arrives in theaters Friday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the goodness of this film. He was kind of, in many ways, the heart of the film because his character loved John Wick,\u201d Fishburne said.\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s always hard when you lose someone that you love dearly ... but you\u2019re also incredibly grateful for the time you had together. We were fortunate enough to work with Lance since the very beginning of the \u2018John Wick\u2019 franchise. I mean it\u2019s been almost 10 years,\u201d director Chad Stahelski said. \u201cI really wish he could be with us tonight, but, you know, life. But we\u2019re very fortunate to have known him. And he\u2019s a great man, a great artist, a great human, a dear friend.\u201d\nShamier Anderson, a newcomer to \u201cWick\u201d franchise, recalled how Reddick took time to say a kind word on set.\n\u201cI grew up watching Lance Reddick. It is a bittersweet moment because he was definitely one of my heroes growing up as an actor, as a Black actor,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cAnd even though we didn\u2019t share screen time together in this film, we shared some time off camera and he was salt of the Earth when he first met me.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Shamier, you\u2019re incredible. I love your work man,\u2019 and like, it melted me like a puddle.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been corrected to fix a misidentification of an actor. He\u2019s Shamier Anderson, not Shamier Moore.",
