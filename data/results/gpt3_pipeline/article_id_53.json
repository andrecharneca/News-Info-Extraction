(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 TikTok went on a counteroffensive Tuesday amid increasing Western pressure over cybersecurity and misinformation concerns , rolling out updated rules and standards for content as its CEO warned against a possible U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned video sharing app.\nCEO Shou Zi Chew is scheduled to appear Thursday before U.S. congressional lawmakers, who will grill him about the company\u2019s privacy and data-security practices and relationship with the Chinese government.\nChew said in a TikTok video that the hearing \u201ccomes at a pivotal moment\u201d for the company, after lawmakers introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration\u2019s authority to enact a U.S. ban on the app, which the CEO said more than 150 million Americans use.\n\u201cSome politicians have started talking about banning TikTok. Now this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,\u201d said Chew, who was dressed casually in jeans and blue hoodie, with the dome of the U.S. Capitol in Washington in the background.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be testifying before Congress this week to share all that we\u2019re are doing to protect Americans using the app,\u201d he said.\nTikTok app has come under fire in the U.S. , Europe and Asia-Pacific , where a growing number of governments have banned TikTok from devices used for official business over worries it poses risks to cybersecurity and data privacy or could be used to push pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation .\nSo far, there is no evidence to suggest this has happened or that TikTok has turned over user data to the Chinese government, as some of its critics have argued it would do.\nNorway and the Netherlands on Tuesday warned apps like TikTok should not be installed on phones issued to government employees, both citing security or intelligence agencies.\nThere\u2019s a \u201chigh risk\u201d if TikTok or Telegram are installed on devices that have access to \u201cinternal digital infrastructure or services,\u201d Norway\u2019s justice ministry said, without providing further details.\nTikTok also rolled out updated rules and standards for content and users in a reorganized set of community guidelines that include eight principles to guide content moderation decisions.\n\u201cThese principles are based on our commitment to uphold human rights and aligned with international legal frameworks,\u201d said Julie de Bailliencourt, TikTok\u2019s global head of product policy.\nShe said TikTok strives to be fair, protect human dignity and balance freedom of expression with preventing harm.\nThe guidelines, which take effect April 21, were repackaged from TikTok\u2019s existing rules with extra details and explanations.\nAmong the more significant changes are additional details about its restrictions on deepfakes, also known as synthetic media created by artificial intelligence technology. TikTok more clearly spells out its policy, saying all deepfakes or manipulated content that show realistic scenes must be labeled to indicate they\u2019re fake or altered in some way.\nTikTok had previously banned deepfakes that mislead viewers about real-world events and cause harm. Its updated guidelines say deepfakes of private figures and young people are also not allowed.\nDeepfakes of public figures are OK in certain contexts, such as for artistic or educational content, but not for political or commercial endorsements.\n_____\nAP writer Jan M.
