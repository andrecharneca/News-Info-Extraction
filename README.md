# News Articles Info Extraction

In this project, we explore 2 approaches for extracting business relations between companies and products:
- An LLM-based method using GPT-3 with a few-shot prompt.
- A PLM (Pre-trained Language Models)-based method, using a pipeline including NER and NLI models.

We compare the performance of the 2 approaches against a manual dataset of 54 news articles from February 2023, yielding over 250 relations and 200 entities.

Project developed by Andr√© Charneca during an internship at CYD Lausanne in 2023, supervised by Ljiljana Dolamic and Angelika Romanou.

## Getting Started
Prepare to run scripts by doing the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/andrecharneca/News-Info-Extraction.git
cd News-Info-Extraction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: the GPT-3 pipeline uses the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Usage
The main scripts in the folder `code/scripts` are:

- `create_articles_and_manual_annotations.py`: creates a `.json` file for every manually annotated article in the manual data (`data/raw/Business news articles - Manual Articles.csv`) to the folder `data/articles`. This is necessary to do **once** before running the models.
- `run_pipelines.py`: runs the GPT and PLM pipelines on the articles and saves the outputs to `.json` files in `data/results/[pipeline name]`.
- `compute_metrics.py`: computes the metrics for the GPT and PLM pipelines.


## Main Packages Used
- [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) (for PLM pipeline)
- OpenAI API
- [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for extracting news articles)
- [cleanco](https://pypi.org/project/cleanco/) (to remove legal suffixes from company names)
